# Healthcare Analysis
Welcome to the repository for healthcare dataset analysis using R Studio! In this project, we have conducted various analyses on a healthcare dataset to derive meaningful insights and visualize trends. This README file will guide you through the contents of this repository and how to navigate through the analysis.

## Overview
This repository contains the following files and directories:

data/: This directory contains the healthcare dataset files used for the analysis. You will find the raw data files (healthcare_data.csv) here.

scripts/: This directory contains the R scripts used for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. The main scripts include:

01_data_cleaning.R: Script for cleaning the raw healthcare dataset.
02_data_analysis.R: Script for conducting various analyses on the cleaned dataset.
03_data_visualization.R: Script for creating visualizations to illustrate the insights.

Start by running 01_data_cleaning.R to clean the dataset.
Next, execute 02_data_analysis.R to perform various analyses.
Finally, run 03_data_visualization.R to generate visualizations.

## Explore Results:
After running the scripts, you will find the results in the results/ directory. Open analysis_report.pdf to read the detailed analysis findings. Additionally, explore the visualizations/ directory for graphs and charts illustrating the insights.

Additional Notes
Dataset Source: The healthcare dataset used in this analysis is sourced from college.
